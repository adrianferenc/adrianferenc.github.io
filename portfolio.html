              is a real time commercial property valuation SaaS product. Elements I worked on include:
              <ul>
                <li> Authentication and Authorization for the React application </li>
                <li> Error logging system based on a REST API on the front and back ends. Built an entire front end diagnostic console to view, search, and filter errors, as well as other database information to help developers, customer service, and those in the C-suite </li>
                <li> User history functionality to easily access search history and load data from any of those searches </li>
                <li> Interactive data visualization tool allowing the user to assign different weights to various valuations presented as circles, or “planets” and see the composite valuation, also a planet, move as if the valuations’ respective “gravities” exerted different amounts of force on the composite </li>
              </ul>
              Made with MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, Bootstrap, Axios, and
              Plotly.js. Deployed with AWS.

              It allows the user to view a sequence as a linear or triangular
              array. It also allows the user to apply a modulus, which is
              represented numerically and by color. Finally, it allows the user
              to view the entire sequence as a scatter plot, a logarithmic
              scatter plot, or a histogram.

              is a one-player version of the classic boardgame Battleship,
              played against an AI that is not easy to beat. The game features
              responsive design and purposefully old school graphics.

              created by Nick Simmons, an economist and math educator in
              Pasadena, California. The game tests players' proficiency with
              basic arithmetic and strategy skills.
